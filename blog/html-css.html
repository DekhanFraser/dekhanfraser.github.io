          What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
          positioning?
        </h1>
        <p>
          We know that every element on a web page is rendered as a block, a
          rectangle with adjustable height and width. The CSS positioning
          properties allow us to manipulate where in the visible area a
          particular block is rendered and how, relative to its neighbors,
          primary ancestor or the entire viewport.
          <em>Relative, absolute and fixed</em> are just three of 5 possible
          options for the positioning property and they all have their specific
          quirks that make them useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Relative positioning</h3>
        <p>
          is pretty easy to understand, once you figure out which element the
          change is relative to. When applying relative positioning only and
          making no other changes, the element will effectively stay the same,
          wherever it is in the document flow. To be able to see a change, you
          need to specify one or a multiple of other attributes:
          <em>top, right, bottom, left</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you apply any of the additional attributes, the element will move
          an appropriate distance in the opposite direction. So a "left: 10px"
          will move the element 10px away from where its original left edge
          would have been in the standard document flow. The important bit here
          is that the element stays in the same order of elements in the
          document flow, and its position is changed <em>relative</em> to that
          position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine you are in a room with you family or friends and everyone has
          taken their usual place on the couch, the armchair, maybe a couple of
          bean-bags, and you are all watching a movie on TV. That is the
          document flow - the usual position of the usual faces. But then you
          decide to move yourself on your beanbag closer to the TV, perhaps in
          front of the couch where your parents are sitting. You are still in
          the same room, watching the same TV, but your position relative to
          everyone else has changed.
        </p>
        <h3>Absolute positioning</h3>
        <p>
          is very handy as it allows you to teleport the element around within
          its nearest parent that also has absolute or relative positioning.
          This may be incredibly useful as using the same
          <em>top, right, bottom, left</em> attributes, you can arrange elements
          with pixel perfect precision within their parent element. The big
          caveat for this however, is that an absolutely positioned element is
          completely broken out of the document flow on the page, meaning that
          it stops affecting other elements and it is not affected by other
          elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          This way of positioning can be imagined somewhat like teleportation,
          or hyperspace travel. Elements in normal space are not aware that
          something is moving through them behind the scenes and stick to their
          element flow on the page, where as te absolutely positioned element
          can teleport anywhere in the solar system, even overlapping another
          planet, wich would certainly cause some catastrophic consequences for
          the element in real space, but on a web-page, it merel makes it
          overlap other elements and create difficulties with reading.
        </p>
        <h3>Fixed positioning</h3>
        <p>
          is kind of like a sticker. Imagine you have a browser open and you
          have a fly sit on your screen. You can scroll the page up and down and
          sideways, but if the fly is not scared, it will just keep sitting on
          top of all the content, completely ignoring you, rubbing its hands and
          making malicious plans. Fixed positioning is always relative to the
          viewport of the browser and ignores any and all other elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example would be to imagine you are wearing glasses and you
          get a smudge on the glass. No matter where you look in the world
          through those glasses, the smudge will always be on top of whetever
          you see.
        </p>
        <h3>Other positioning options</h3>
        <p>
          There are two other possible positioning options, which are
          <em>static</em> and <em>sticky</em>. Static is the default state of an
          element, in the event that you have not applied any other positioning
          attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sticky on the other hand has an interesting way of interacting with
          its parent element. Lets say you have a table with a header row. As
          you scroll down through the table, a sticky header row will appear
          normal until you scroll past it, at which point it will stick at the
          top of the page and behave like a fixed element within its parent
          element. This can be used for many semi-permanent applictions, like
          article breadcrumbs within "endless" pages of articles, where new
          posts keep appearing as you keep scrolling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this will give you a better undestanding of the positioning
          property and help avoid confusion.
