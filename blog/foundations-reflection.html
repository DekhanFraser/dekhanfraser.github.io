                <h1>Foundations reflections</h1>
                <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    I would say three things I have learnt in foundations is that I very much dislike writing about my feelings. I don't get easily frustrated
                    or angry and I tend to ignore things that do not affect me or my close circle directly. In general, the subtle art of not giving a fuck has
                    taught me that it is much easier to cut off toxic people from your circle than try to explain to them why they are toxic. Granted, everyone
                    has their own definition of toxicity, but I am pretty conservative on that matter.
                </p>
                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    Respect yourself and dont let anyone bully you, be aware that everyone learns at their own pace and help others when you can and if they are
                    willing to accept the help.
                </p>
                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    That you have to teach it at all. Most of the things in Human Skills is just common sense if you want to fit into society. We used to get
                    that education from your parents in my generation.
                </p>
                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
                <p>None</p>
                <h3>
                    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Because human skills are important, however, the modern society tends to ignore teaching these basis skills in the family unit more often
                    than not nowadays.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
                    programming instead? Justify your answer.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I wouldn't say Human Skills are a complete waste of time, however, there are caveats. They are a great reminder that these things exist, and
                    are probably necessary for some people that have little life experience. Personally, I have had life hit me on the head enough times that I
                    have learnt my lessons already a long time ago, so I would prefer to spend time coding and getting things done instead.
