      <h1>What is emotional intelligence?</h1>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand and
        manage one's own emotions, as well as understand and influence other
        people's emotions. Emotional Intelligence (or EQ for short) is
        considered an important set of skills to have to be relevant in the
        modern society, as they affect how you can present yourself and
        partcipate in the community you are a part of, be it your family,
        workplace, or the wider community based on other attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Intelligence Quotient (or IQ) is considered to be mostly an
        inherited attribute of a person, that can be improved upon depending
        on the environment the person grows up in and other factors. In
        contrast, EQ is a skillset that can be trained, even if you start from
        zero. You can do so via three general steps:
      <ul>
        <li>The practice of mindfulness: helps with better awareness of oneself and the world around them. It is usually
          associated with meditations and involves paying attention to your thoughts, emotions, bodily feelings and the
          surrounding environment with opennenss and acceptance. Practicing mindfulness tends to lead to less anxiety
          and stress, as well as better focus, concentration and emotional well-being.</li>
        <li>Self-knowledge and self-mastery: this one is more or less self-explanatory. Knowing your won strengths and
          weaknesses allows you to make informed decisions and set meaningful goals for yourself, while the ability to
          manage your emotions, impulses and behaviors helps with overcoming obstacles along the way and maintaining a
          sense of balance. Both of these are important for personal growth and success in life, regardless of the area
          in question.</li>
        <li>Building mental habits: ake the above and incorporate it into your daily routine. Mindfulness and
          self-reflection is useful learning to manage one's reactivity, positive thinking and goal setting helps with
          setting realistic goals and overcoming obstacles to reaching them. All of it and more over time helps with
          building a well-rounded baanced approach to life.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key point here is consistency. Start small and build up habits that enrichen your life and well-being. At least, that is the idea.</p>
